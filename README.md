# Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This Snake Game AI is an implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame. The game features an artificial intelligence (AI) agent that learns to play the game using Q-learning. The agent is trained through reinforcement learning to maximize its score by avoiding collisions with the boundaries and itself while collecting food.
